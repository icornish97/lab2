## Question set #1 (Group)

1. There were 1852 chocolate bars reviewed 
2. The number of ratings gradually increases until  the year of 2016 where we see a continual decrease in the number of ratings though the present.

```{R}
library(ggplot2)
choco <- read.csv("https://ds202-at-isu.github.io/labs/data/choco.csv")
head(choco)
ggplot(aes(x = Review.Date),data = choco) + geom_bar()
```
## Question set #2 (Team)
1. The distribution of the ratings is unimodal and fairly symmetric. There are outliers above at 5, and below at 1 and 1.5. The median appears to be about 3 or 3.25.
```{R}
ggplot(data = choco, aes(x = Rating)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = .25)
```

2.From what we have observed there is not a significant impact on the rating of the chocolate based on the cocoa percentage. That being said there were some interesting observations worth noting. 
 + No chocolate with a 90% cocoa percentage or above had a 4 or higher rating. 
 + The higher the rating the tighter the distribution of cocoa percentage got to 70%. 
 + The only five star rating had a cocoa percentage of 70%
 + One of the chocolates that recieved a one star ratings also had a cocoa percentage of 70%
 
```{R}
ggplot(aes(x=Rating, y = Cocoa.Pct), data = choco) + geom_point()
```

3. Across the different company locations in the top 3 countries with the most ratings The USA has a significant greater amount of ratings compared to France and Canada which are similar. France and Canada have between 100 and 200 ratings while the USA has almost 800
```{R}
Top3<- dplyr::filter(choco, Company.Location %in% c("U.S.A.", "France", "Canada"))
ggplot(data=Top3, aes(x=Company.Location))+geom_bar()
```
