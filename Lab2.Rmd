## Question set #1 (Group)

1. There were 1852 chocolate bars reviewed 
2. The number of ratings gradually increases until  the year of 2016 where we see a continual decrease in the number of ratings though the present.

```{R}
library(ggplot2)
choco <- read.csv("https://ds202-at-isu.github.io/labs/data/choco.csv")
head(choco)
ggplot(aes(x = Review.Date),data = choco) + geom_bar()
```

3.


## Question set #2

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
